# Toxic Tweets Classification Project

This project aims to classify tweets as toxic or non-toxic using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

## Project Overview

The project involves the following steps:

1. **Data Acquisition**: Download the dataset.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the text data, tokenize the text, and convert it to lowercase.
3. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Bag of Words (BoW): Convert text data into a matrix of token counts.
   - TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): Convert text data into a matrix of TF-IDF features.
4. **Model Building**:
   - Decision Trees
   - Random Forest
   - Naive Bayes
   - K-NN Classifier
   - SVM (Support Vector Machine)
5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate models using metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC curve.
6. **Optimization (Optional)**: Tune hyperparameters of models for better performance.
7. **Conclusion**: Summarize results and discuss potential improvements.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

## Usage

1. Download the dataset and place it in the project directory.
2. Run the Jupyter notebook `toxic_tweets_classification.ipynb` to execute the project pipeline.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess data, build models, and evaluate performance.

## Results

- Results obtained from different models will be summarized in the notebook.
- Evaluation metrics including precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC curve will be provided.
